# Rocket Landing Algorithms (EA)

**Overview**  
This project focuses on the analysis and implements an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to optimize the weights of a neural network controller for spacecraft landing navigation. Built on a Java-based framework, the simulation evaluates landing performance using a fitness function and requires the implementation of key evolutionary operators like Selection, Reproduction, and Replacement.  

The study explores various parameters, including activation functions and mutation rates, to enhance the algorithm's effectiveness. This README details the implementation process, performance evaluation through training and testing runs, and identifies areas for future improvement.

## Challenges  
One challenge was ensuring that the algorithm could adapt to varying environmental conditions (like wind). I tackled this by incorporating adaptive parameters in the evolutionary algorithm.

## What I Learned 
This project deepened my understanding of evolutionary algorithms and their applications in real-world problems. I also improved my coding and simulation skills.

## Future Improvements 
- Implement additional constraints to simulate real-world physics more accurately.
- Enhance the visual output for better analysis of the landing process.

## Demo
To see the algorithm in action, run the `landing_simulation.py` script. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
